# Bank-webpage

You can view the live demo here:
https://bank-web-project.netlify.app/

In this project the concepts I've mainly focused are:
- JavaScript
- Advanced DOM and Events
- Modal Window
- Page Navigation using Event delegation
- Sticky navigation using Intersection Observer API
- Lazy Loading images
- Sliders

I didn't focused on css and responsiveness. Please view in larger devices..! Thanks.
